# StudyGrapher

## Inspiration

As students, we often struggle with managing our study time effectively, especially when preparing for exams. We created StudyGrapher to help visualize exam topics and their relative importance, making it easier to prioritize studying material that will actually appear on the test, and to allocate our study time more efficiently. We were inspired by the idea of using interactive data visualization to simplify complex information and make it more accessible.

## What it does

StudyGrapher is an interactive web application that visualizes exam topics. Each node on the page represents a topic, with the size of the node proportional to the recommended study time. The topics within each node are ranked based on their relative importance in the exam, with 1 being most important and common on the test. Users can hover over a node to view detailed information about the topic, including its description, exam percentage, and study time. The graph is interactive, allowing users to drag nodes around.

## How we built it

We built StudyGrapher using a combination of web technologies:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3.js library (for creating the interactive graph), Bootstrap (for responsive design and styling)
- **Backend**: Node.js (reads exam topics data from a CSV file generated by the Claude API and serves it to the frontend)
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito for email authentication and delivering weekly study tips
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaboration

## Challenges we ran into

- Organizing the exam topics data in a format that could be easily visualized using D3.js
- Prompt engineering the Claude model to ensure uniform formatting and correct data structure in the generated CSV files
- Optimizing the performance of the graph, especially when dealing with a large number of nodes
- Token cost limitations, requiring a downgrade from the Claude 3 Opus model to the Claude 3 Haiku
- Integrating AWS Cognito for user authentication and email delivery

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Creating a functional and visually appealing tool that addresses a real problem faced by students
- Successfully integrating various web technologies and libraries to create a seamless user experience
- Implementing user authentication and email delivery for personalized study tips using AWS Cognito
- Delivering a working prototype that demonstrates the potential of data visualization in the education domain, despite time constraints

## What we learned

- Working with D3.js for creating interactive data visualizations
- Structuring and manipulating data to create meaningful representations
- Prompt engineering to get desired results from the Claude model
- Integrating AWS Cognito for user authentication and email delivery
- Importance of effective collaboration and communication

## What's next for StudyGrapher

- Providing more data to the user, such as study material for each topic
- Integrating machine learning algorithms to provide personalized study recommendations based on user preferences and performance
- Making the graph directed, with related topics pointing to one another
- Expanding the use of AWS services to enhance scalability and functionality
